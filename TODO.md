# TODO: Push Angular Project to GitHub Repository

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Step 1: Check Git status and initialize repository if necessary (`git status` and `git init` if needed). - Completed: Repository is initialized on branch main with uncommitted changes.
- [x] Step 2: Update remote origin to https://github.com/LengVansan/LengVansan_SV13.git (existing remote was different). - Completed.
- [ ] Step 3: Stage all files (`git add .`).
- [ ] Step 4: Commit changes (`git commit -m "Initial commit: Push Angular SV13 project"`).
- [ ] Step 5: Push to main branch (`git push -u origin main`).
- [ ] Step 6: Verify push success and handle any errors (e.g., branch name, authentication).

## Notes
- Ensure GitHub repository exists and is accessible.
- If default branch is 'master' instead of 'main', adjust push command accordingly.
- Update this file as each step is completed.
